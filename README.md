How to get the data:
1. Download a full dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/tanlikesmath/diabetic-retinopathy-resized.
Then you should put all the files to folder "data". Also, create in that folder "data" folder "npy_files".
2. Run "1. preprocessing"

How to run:
1. Run "2. experiments"

Where are the results?
Each model that we run has logs in jupyter-cell outputs. If you did "How to run" part, you will see them.
In the next commit (maybe, not in the context of AI couse work) I will generalize a perfomance information in a better way.
